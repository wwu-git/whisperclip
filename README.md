## 📋 Requirements

- **Apple Silicon Mac** (M1, M2, M3, or later)
- **macOS 14.0** or later
- **20GB** free disk space (for AI models)
- **Microphone access** permission
- **Accessibility permissions** (for global hotkeys)
- **Apple Events permissions** (for clipboard operations)

## 🚀 Installation

### Download Pre-built App
1. Visit [whisperclip.com](https://whisperclip.com)
2. Download the latest release
3. Drag WhisperClip.app to your Applications folder
4. Follow the setup guide for permissions

### Build from Source
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/cydanix/whisperclip.git
cd whisperclip

# Build the app
./build.sh

# For development
./local_build.sh Debug
./local_run.sh Debug
```

## 🔧 Usage

### Quick Start
1. **Launch WhisperClip** from Applications or menu bar
2. **Grant permissions** when prompted (microphone, accessibility)
3. **Download AI models** through the setup guide
4. **Press Option+Space** (or click Record) to start recording
5. **Press again to stop** - text will be automatically copied to clipboard

### Batch folder transcription
On **Audio File**, use **Batch transcription** to select an input folder (recursive scan) and an output folder. Each audio file becomes a `.txt` with the same relative path. Options include applying the current prompt, continuing on error, conflict policy when outputs already exist, and canceling a run in progress.

### Customization
- **Change hotkey**: Settings → Hotkey preferences
- **Add custom prompts**: Settings → Prompts → Add new prompt
- **Switch AI models**: Setup Guide → Download different models
- **Configure auto-actions**: Settings → Enable auto-paste/auto-enter

## 🤖 Supported AI Models

**Parakeet** (default, recommended)
- Fast transcription using Apple Neural Engine
- 25 European languages supported
- Optimized for Apple Silicon

**WhisperKit** (alternative)
- **OpenAI Whisper Small** (216MB) - Fast, good quality
- **OpenAI Whisper Large v3 Turbo** (632MB) - Best balance
- **Distil Whisper Large v3 Turbo** (600MB) - Optimized speed
- **OpenAI Whisper Large v2 Turbo** (955MB) - Maximum accuracy

### Text Enhancement (Local LLMs)
- **Gemma 2 (2B/9B)** - Google's efficient models
- **Llama 3/3.2 (3B/8B)** - Meta's powerful models
- **Qwen 2.5/3 (1.5B-8B)** - Alibaba's multilingual models

All models run locally using MLX for Apple Silicon optimization.

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

WhisperClip is designed with privacy as the cornerstone:

- **Local Processing Only**: All voice recognition and AI processing happens on your device
- **No Network Requests**: Except for downloading models from Hugging Face
- **No Analytics**: No usage tracking, no telemetry, no data collection
- **Open Source**: Full transparency - inspect the code yourself
- **Sandboxed**: Runs in Apple's secure app sandbox
- **Encrypted Storage**: AI models stored securely on device
